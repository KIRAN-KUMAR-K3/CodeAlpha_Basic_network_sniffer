## 📌 About the Project

The Simulated Network Sniffer is a browser-based application built to help students, developers, and cybersecurity enthusiasts learn the fundamentals of packet capture and protocol analysis — without requiring root access or complex system setup.

Instead of capturing live traffic, this app uses Google’s Gemini AI to generate highly realistic, protocol-based packet data. The result? A powerful, safe, and interactive simulation of how actual sniffers work.

> 🧠 Learn the structure of real-world packets.
> 👨‍💻 Explore protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP.
> 📊 Inspect detailed packet data — all in your browser.
